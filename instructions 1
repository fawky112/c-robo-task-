(design task )
You are required to design a bank system in C++ with the following specifications:

Create a parent class that includes three common functions shared by all tellers.

Implement three child classes representing different tellers. Each child class should inherit from the parent class.

Each teller should have one unique special function in addition to the inherited functions.

Include a private timer (or counter) for each teller. Once the timer ends, the teller is considered closed and can no longer be accessed.

Store all teller objects in a vector.

Use at least one dynamically allocated object (e.g., a class pointer).

Finally, print the data of all tellers stored in the vector.
note evrey class should be modulated
